# Gallery Block Lightbox

This WordPress Plugin adds a simple & lightweight Lightbox to the standard WordPress Image Gallery Block. It detects if a post contains a Gallery Block and then loads & initializea [baguetteBox.js](https://github.com/feimosi/baguetteBox.js), a pure JavaScript Lightbox script without any dependencies and a modern minimal look.

There is no lock in effect. It does not add a new Block Editor/Gutenberg Block and relies solo on the standard WordPress Gallery Block. You can deactivate this plugin at any time and your Gallery Blocks will work as they've done before. Just without the lightbox.

Just **one important thing to remember**: You always have to select *Link to* â†’ *Media File* for all of your Galleries to work properly. If you choose *None* or *Attachment Page* it will not work.
